# Instructions for the `src` Code Folder

This folder contains all the necessary scripts and notebooks for the project. It is organized into two main subfolders: `notebooks` and `scripts`.

---

## Notebooks subfolder

All Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) are stored in this folder. Files are named in sequential order based on the steps they should be run.

- `00_sample1.ipynb`: Brief description of what this notebook does, e.g., "Initial data exploration."
- `01_sample1.ipynb`: Brief description of what this notebook does, e.g., "Data cleaning and preprocessing."
- `02_sample1.ipynb`: Brief description of what this notebook does, e.g., "Model training and evaluation."

---

## Scripts subfolder

All Python scripts (`.py`) are stored in this folder. Files are named in sequential order to guide you through the process.

- `00_sample1.py`: Brief description of the script, e.g., "Setup and import necessary libraries."
- `01_sample1.py`: Brief description of the script, e.g., "Data loading and preprocessing."
- `02_sample1.py`: Brief description of the script, e.g., "Model training and evaluation."

### How to Run

- The order of execution is important. Follow the numbering of each file to ensure proper flow and dependencies.
- For notebooks: Run them sequentially in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
- For scripts: Run them from top to bottom using `python script_name.py` in your terminal.

By following this structure, you will be able to seamlessly work through the project and ensure that all processes are executed in the correct sequence.
