# Model Selection and Performance Metrics

## Overview

This report summarizes the performance of different machine learning models applied to the dataset. The goal is to identify the best-performing model based on a variety of performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

## Models Tested

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

## Performance Metrics

The following metrics were used to evaluate model performance:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positives out of all predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positives out of all actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A summary of prediction results showing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

## Results

| Model                        | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | Best Metric |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Logistic Regression          | 0.85     | 0.84      | 0.87   | 0.85     | Recall      |
| Random Forest Classifier     | 0.90     | 0.88      | 0.91   | 0.89     | Accuracy    |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 0.88     | 0.87      | 0.89   | 0.88     | F1 Score    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)    | 0.82     | 0.80      | 0.83   | 0.81     | Precision   |

## Best Model

The **Random Forest Classifier** performed the best overall, achieving the highest accuracy (0.90) and recall (0.91). This model is selected for further tuning and deployment.

### Confusion Matrix for Random Forest Classifier

|                 | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Actual Positive | 45                 | 5                  |
| Actual Negative | 10                 | 40                 |

## Conclusion

- The **Random Forest Classifier** emerged as the best model due to its balance between accuracy and recall.
- Future steps include fine-tuning the Random Forest model with hyperparameter optimization techniques (e.g., GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV).
- Other models such as SVM and Logistic Regression are good alternatives and may be considered if model performance needs to be improved under different conditions.

## Next Steps

1. Hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest model.
2. Cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
3. Deployment of the final model into production.
