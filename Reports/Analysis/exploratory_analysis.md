# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report

## Overview

This report documents the initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. The goal is to understand the structure of the data, identify patterns, check for missing or anomalous values, and visualize key distributions and correlations between features. The analysis also includes observations regarding data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.

## Data Overview

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each record.
- **feature_1**: Numerical feature representing some aspect of the data.
- **feature_2**: Another numerical feature related to the data.
- **target**: The target variable, indicating the outcome (binary classification).

There are **1000 rows** in the dataset.

## Initial Data Inspection

The first step is to load the dataset and take a look at the first few rows:

```python
data.head()
```
