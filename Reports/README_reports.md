# Reports Folder

This folder contains all reports, visualizations, and summaries generated during the project. These files provide insights into the data, analysis steps, and model performance. Below is an explanation of each file and subfolder, as well as guidelines for adding new reports.

## Files

### `summary_report.pdf`

- **Description**: A comprehensive report summarizing the findings of the analysis, including key insights, methods, and conclusions. This report may be used for presenting results to stakeholders.
- **Contents**:
  - Executive summary
  - Key findings
  - Overview of methodology
  - Visualizations of main results

## Folders

### `visualizations/`

Contains all visualizations generated throughout the analysis, stored as image files for easy reference or embedding in reports.

- **data_overview.png**: Graphical summary of the dataset, including distributions of key features.
- **correlation_heatmap.png**: Heatmap showing correlations between features in the dataset, helpful for identifying relationships.
- **model_performance.png**: Visualization of model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to showcase model effectiveness.

### `analysis/`

Contains markdown or text-based reports that break down specific aspects of the analysis.

- **exploratory_analysis.md**: Detailed write-up of exploratory data analysis (EDA), covering initial insights, distributions, correlations, and data cleaning observations.
- **model_results.md**: A report on model selection and performance metrics, comparing results across different models and highlighting the best-performing model.

## Guidelines for Adding Reports

1. **File Naming**: Use clear and descriptive names for all files and folders. For example, use names like `feature_importance.png` or `precision_recall_chart.pdf` for visualizations related to model evaluation.
2. **Formats**: Save reports in accessible formats such as `.pdf`, `.png`, or `.md`.
3. **Documentation**: Ensure each report includes an overview of its contents, methodology, and any conclusions drawn. Major reports should include a brief summary in this `README.md`.
4. **Versioning**: If reports are updated, consider versioning them with suffixes (e.g., `summary_report_v2.pdf`) or archiving older versions in an `archive/` folder.

## Example Summary for Major Reports

For each major report or visualization added to this folder, document it here with a brief description:

- **`summary_report.pdf`**: Comprehensive report covering the entire project analysis and findings, ideal for sharing with stakeholders.
- **`data_overview.png`**: Provides a visual snapshot of the data distributions and key statistics for reference in presentations.
- **`correlation_heatmap.png`**: Useful for identifying feature relationships, informing feature selection and engineering steps.
